Welcome to oneFileDeSo !!



This is our project for The DeSo Hackathon-2022 to help the community build more projects.

oneFileDeso is freeware and an open source starter kit, in one file, for you to connect to the DeSo API. Written in PHP, javascript, html, and css.

Out of the box, this one file on any webserver will display a "Following" feed of posts from people you follow.

We believe this will open access to the the DeSo Blockchain to tens of thousands of php programmers all over the world.
